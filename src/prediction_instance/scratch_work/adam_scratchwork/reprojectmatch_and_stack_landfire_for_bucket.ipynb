    "This code is part of a preprocessing step for static layers used in firenet. It involves loading various landfire layers, reprojecting them to a common coordinate reference system (CRS), and then stacking them together into a single multi-layered dataset. Landfire data gives spatial information such as elevation, vegetation height etc. that are useful to feed into firenet when it makes inference via interpreting spectral satellite data.\n",

    "The reprojected layers are matched to the CRS of a median image to ensure spatial alignment across all layers. This combined dataset is then saved as a NetCDF file for further use. \n",

    "Memory management is also considered by manually invoking garbage collection after processing each layer to ensure the environment won't crash.\n"
