    "This code is part of a preprocessing step for static layers used in firenet. It involves loading various landfire layers, reprojecting them to a common coordinate reference system (CRS), and then stacking them together into a single multi-layered dataset. Landfire data gives spatial information such as elevation, vegetation height etc. that are useful to feed into firenet when it makes inference via interpreting spectral satellite data.\n",
