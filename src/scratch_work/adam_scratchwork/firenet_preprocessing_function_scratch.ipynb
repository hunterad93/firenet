    "3. Concatenate the 12 datasets into one, effectively creating a dataset with a time dimension\n",
    "4. Take median over the time dimension, so each pixel has median value of the last hour for each band\n",
    "5. Feature engineer the median dataset, adding more informative bands that are ratios of the spectral channels\n",
    "6. Download the preprocessed landfire layers. Preproprecessing done in `reprojectmatch_and_stack_landfire_for_bucket.ipynb`. Reproject_match GOES to this layers\n",
    "7. Stack the GOES ds with the preprocessed landfire layers into a dataset.\n",
    "8. Pull data vars out as a 21 dimensional numpy array, leaving a 'template raster' which has nan data values and all the spatial metadata attached.\n",
    "9. Chunk the numpy array into 21x64x64 chunks, normalize each chunk per axis 0 level. In otherwords normalize each band to values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "10. Pass fully processed chunks through the unet model, receiving 1x64x64 numpy arrays on other side.\n",
    "11. Stitch the predicted chunks back together, then replace the template raster empty array with the stitched predictions.\n",
    "12. Now we have an nc with values between 0 and 1, 0 reflecting no fire 1 reflecting yes.\n",
